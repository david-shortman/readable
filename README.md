# Readable

![Comparison of a Twitter post before and after using Readable. Before, the tweet has text that cannot be read by a screen reader. After, the tweet has readable text. Above the comparison, an in-image caption reads: "Converts non-standard text to scree reader-compatible text."](icons/48.png)

Readable is a Web Extension that converts "custom font" text on webpages to standard characters, which can be read as intended by screen readers.

[Example on Extension Homepage](https://readableextension.app)

## Installation

The extension is undergoing review in the Chrome Web Store, the Mozilla add-ons distribution site, and the macOS App Store.

The source code can be downloaded and then [imported as an unpacked extension into Chrome](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).
