![Comparison of a Twitter post before and after using Readable. Before, the tweet has text that cannot be read by a screen reader. After, the tweet has readable text. Above the comparison, an in-image caption reads: "Converts non-standard text to scree reader-compatible text."](icons/48.png)

Readable is a Web Extension that converts "custom font" text on webpages to standard characters, which can be read as intended by screen readers.
